#
# Defaults are :
#
# cpupowerdown = 1 ( seconds )
# suspendtimer  = 30 (seconds )
# suspendoncharge = 0
# respectgsettings = 0

set cpupowerdown to 0 to avoid cpu cores being powered off
set suspendtimer to 0 to avoid suspending your phone
set suspendoncharge to 1 to suspend while the charger if connected AND a suspend should happen.
set respectgsettings to 1 to follow the gsettings of PINE user. 

## ATTN: if your pinephone distro does not use "pine" as user, you need to recompile the source accordingly!


Settingslocation: /etc/suspendguardian

Build:

gcc suspendguardian.c -o /usr/bin/suspendguardian
chmod 700 /usr/bin/suspendguardian

Create defaults:

mkdir -p /etc/suspendguardian
echo 30 > /etc/suspendguardian/suspendtimer
echo 1 > /etc/suspendguardian/cpupowerdown
echo 0 > /etc/suspendguardian/suspendoncharge
echo 0 > /etc/suspendguardian/respectgsettings

place the suspendguardian.service file into /usr/lib/systemd/system/

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable -once suspendguardian

Debugging:

stop systemd service
start suspendguardian in a rootshell
watch what happens

NOTE:

if you system does not use Phosh or a gnome compatible system, "respectgsettings" option will not work for you. Disable it to get a clean run.

If you use a different kernel than fedora, it's possible you need to adapt the /sys/class/ paths and filenames.

Description:

it simply disables 3 CPU Cores when the display wents offline, may give problems while doing calls and the screen gets powered off. 
As long as the screen just gets dark, nothing happens.
If the screen is lit again, the cores get enabled again.

After X seconds system goes into suspend. Default is 30 seconds, hardcoded are 60s as fallback default. This is far less time as gsettings allow.

Suspend can be intercepted by creating a file /var/run/suspendguardian.intercept which gives other apps the opportunity to delay a suspend for 10 seconds every time
the suspendtimer is hit. 

Suspend and Cpu Core Powerdown can be configured. See on top of this file.

Have Fun.

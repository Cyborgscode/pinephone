This script is free to use. If you change it, place a note in your code, on which your code was build on.

## It's designed for PINEPHONEs ##

But can easily adapted to any screensize.

Installation:

place both scripts in ~/.local/bin
chmod 755 ~/.local/bin/windowmaximizer*

This example desktopfile may help to get an executable appicon in gnome:

[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Name=WindowMaximizer
Name[de_DE]=WindowMaximizer
Exec=windowmaximizerwatch
#Terminal=false
Type=Application
StartupNotify=true
#Icon=cs-login
Icon=/usr/share/icons/Mint-X/apps/96/cs-login.svg
MimeType=x-content/unix-software
Categories=Network;
Keywords=web;internet;
X-Desktop-File-Install-Version=0.23


You may wanne change the icon of it to your needs. The desktopfiles goes to /usr/share/applications .

Usage:

call windowmaximizerwatch to execute the mainscript in a once per second loop.
You can execute the mainscript manually, but if it shall work automatically and remove nolonger existing window ids, 
so that it functions correctly when they reappear, a loop is mandatory. 

What does it do:

It checks the orientation of the screen and send all windows, it does not have processed yet, a maximize cmd via wmctrl cmds. 
If the orientation changes, it reprocesses all open windows again. 

It also calculates the window height in the presence of ONBOARD. It does not recognize gnomes internal osk, but it should work, 
as apps should react to the osk correctly. 

ATTN: apps you would associate with gnome like gnome-maps, gnome-weather, gnomes-control-center etc. seem to ignore theire windowmanager and do theire own thing.
This can manifest itself as window centered on screen, but not maximized fully; Windows not following at all etc. etc.  Gnome is informed.

Hi,

do anything as root.

1. copy the desktop file to /usr/share/application/

2. chmod 644 /usr/share/application/screenrotate.desktop

3. copy autorotate script /usr/local/sbin/   

4. chmod 755  /usr/local/sbin/autorotate

5. 

place a matching picture for the logo at /home/pine/Bilder/screenrotate.png

OR

use a different path and name in the desktopfile.

6. OPTIONAL .. AUTOSTART

If you want autostarting it on login of your phone, copy the desktop file to ~/.config/autostart/ .



### HOW IT WORKS ###

You need: wlr-randr installed. 

The /sys/bus path can change from kernel to kernel. These one are for Megi's FEDORA AARCH64 5.11.2 Kernel. 

The app kills itself, if it's already running, otherwise it starts. So it's easy to tunr it on or off by starting it from the desktop.
